# Bridge Of Death

Inspired by Bridge of Death in Monty Python where you had to answer 3 questions correctly to pass or be thrown over the cliff: [Video Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV0tCphFMr8)

This is a guess the number game with 5 chances (watch the video to understand why 5 instead of 3).

It was built with no frameworks or scaffolding.
